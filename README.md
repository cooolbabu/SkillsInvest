# Value Proposition

There are many software professionals who need to invest in their skills. In order to build skills, you need infrastructure(playground) to experiment. With "Serverless architecture" being the future, you will need cloud subscription to keep building your skills. This will cost money. How much is the question? 
 
Traditionally, a laptop and Open-source software or Trial versions, were sufficient to build your skills or keep them updated. A laptop is a fixed cost and the rest is 'Time'. With Cloud having 'Pay-as-you-go', there is no way of knowing how much to budget, to achieve a certain goal. For example, It cost me $500 in Microsoft Azure subscription fees to get myself certified as Microsoft Azure Data Engineer Associate.
 
I am unwilling to move forward on Azure Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence, because it will personally cost me around $1000/month to learn and experiment. This is based on my experience with Azure subscription and good knowledge on how leverage free resources. I understand that Spark clusters and GPUs are not cheap for either Microsoft or the Learners. This number $1000/month is a good guess.
 
# Managing costs

<p>Traditionally, software developers never considered infrastructure costs, as they were always a Fixed-Cost. Either you have the systems, or you don't.  With pay-as-you-go, software developers need to understand the cost of running every bit of code they deliver.</p>
<p>Financial discipline is a cultural shift that will happen over the next few decades. Financial discipline and training is not provided as part of any curriculum. With Serverless architecture being the future, software engineers have no choice but subscribe to a cloud subscription to keep their skills updated.</p>
 
# Target Market

Learners who subscribe to courses in Coursera, Udemy, Udacity, Bootcamps and Microsoft Learn. Learners need to budget and exercise Financial discipline as part of their journey. These skills are then applied as part of their professional journey.
 
# Product differentiation

Understand the costs and incorporate it into a curriculum that I plan to develop and sell into the Professional education industry. The curriculum will educate the cause and effect of various knobs and switches within Microsoft Azure.  For example, what is the subscription cost to become a ML Engineer or AI Engineer. How to become an expert on a low or reasonable budget
 
# First product

<p>ML Engineer certification</p>

* Education cost = Cost of Curriculum + Microsoft Azure Subscription cost.  

<p>Understand the cost and budget appropriately. Develop Financial discipline as part of your education journey. For most people, education cost is subsidized or free. It will help those companies allocate sufficient resources.</p>
<p>On the hand, independent consultants or people looking for a career change or people looking to build new skills need to know education cost. It will help them plan and complete their journey successfully</p>
 
# Future products

This is a repeatable pattern that can be applied to various learning paths.
 
# Benefits

Financial discipline is a new dimension in the Software Engineers skillset. Employers will appreciate both technical skills and cost awareness. <p>For Microsoft, it will be a differentiating factor, when technical resources are able to deliver more value at a reasonable cost.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time</p>
