#Value Proposition

There are many software professionals who need to invest in their skills. In order to build skills, you need infrastructure(playground) to experiment. With "Serverless architecture" being the future, you will need cloud subscription to keep building your skills. This will cost money. How much is the question? 
 
Traditionally, a laptop and Open-source software or Trial versions, were sufficient to build your skills or keep them updated. A laptop is a fixed cost and the rest is 'Time'. With Cloud having 'Pay-as-go', there is no way of knowing how much to budget, to achieve a certain goal. For example, It cost me $500 in Microsoft Azure subscription fees to get myself certified as Microsoft Azure Data Engineer Associate.
 
I am unwilling to move forward on Azure Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence, because it will personally cost me around $1000/month to learn and experiment. This is based on my experience with Azure subscription. I understand that Spark clusters and GPUs are not cheap for either Microsoft or the Learners. This number 1000/month is only a guess.
